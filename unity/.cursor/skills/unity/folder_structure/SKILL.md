# Unity Project Organization

## Assets/ Subdirectory Mapping
- `Art/`: Materials, Models, Textures, Animations, Sprites.
- `Systems/`: Reusable modules (own `Scripts/Runtime`, optional `Scripts/Editor`, `Tests`).
- `Features/`: Project-specific gameplay (own `Scripts/Runtime`, optional prefabs/scenes/tests).
- `Core/`: Shared project glue (event bus, settings, composition root/injector, shared UI).
- `AddressableAssets/`: Content organized by concurrent usage or logical entity strategy.
- `Prefabs/`: Consistent subfolders for Characters, Environment, UI, and Effects.

## Assembly Definition (.asmdef)
All major systems must have their own assembly definitions.
- `Core.asmdef`
- `Gameplay.asmdef`
- `UI.asmdef`

## Scene & Prefab Organization
- **Hierarchy Sections**: Use sections like `--- SYSTEMS ---`, `--- LEVEL ---`, and `--- DYNAMIC ---`.
- **Prefab Components**: Separate visual models, colliders, effects, and audio sources into child objects.
